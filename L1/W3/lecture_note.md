# Define Data and Establish Baseline

## Why is data definition hard?

### Introduction

*   Importance of defining the right data for training and modeling.
*   Example used: detecting iguanas in images.

### Labeling Example: Iguanas

*   Scenario: Hundreds of iguana pictures sent to labelers for bounding box labeling.
*   Labeling variations:
    1.  First labeler: Labels one iguana, two iguanas.
    2.  Second labeler: Labels considering the tail, also marks one iguana, two iguanas.
    3.  Third labeler: Labels with different bounding boxes.
*   Key point: All three labelers are diligent and hardworking but have different labeling styles.
*   Preferred labeling: Top two labeling styles.
*   Issue: Inconsistent labeling across labelers leads to confusion for the learning algorithm.

### Practical Computer Vision Problems

*   Example: Phone defect detection.
    *   Labeling instructions: Use bounding boxes for significant defects.
    *   Labeling variations:
        1.  First labeler: Labels the most significant scratch.
        2.  Second labeler: Labels two defects (scratch and pits mark).
        3.  Third labeler: Uses a single bounding box for all defects.
    *   Preferred labeling: Middle option.
    *   Issue: Inconsistent labeling with ambiguous instructions.

### Importance of Consistent Labeling

*   Consistent labeling with one convention improves learning algorithm performance.
*   Example: Middle labeling convention for phone defects.

### Week's Focus

*   Best practices for data preparation in the machine learning project cycle.
*   Topics:
    1.  Defining what data to use (x and y).
    2.  Establishing a baseline for labeling and organizing data.
*   Goal: Create a high-quality dataset for the modeling phase.

### Practical Considerations

*   Initial approach: Many researchers and engineers download pre-prepared data from the internet.
*   Impact: Data preparation significantly affects the success of a machine learning project.

## More label ambiguity examples

### Introduction

*   Importance of defining data and addressing label ambiguity.
*   Examples: Speech recognition and structured data (e.g., user ID merge).

### Label Ambiguity in Speech Recognition

*   Example: Audio clip of someone asking for the nearest gas station.
*   Ambiguities:
    1.  Different spellings: "umm" with one or two m's.
    2.  Punctuation: Comma vs. ellipsis.
    3.  Unintelligible parts: Whether to include "unintelligible" at the end.
*   Standardizing transcription conventions helps improve speech recognition algorithms.

### Label Ambiguity in Structured Data

*   Example: User ID merge in large companies.
    *   Situation: Merging data records from a website and a newly acquired mobile app.
    *   Ambiguities:
        1.  Determining if two data records represent the same person.
        2.  Supervised learning algorithms can help if ground truth data is available.
        3.  Human labelers use judgment to match records based on similar names or zip codes.
*   Importance of consistent labeling to improve algorithm performance.

### Common Structured Data Applications

1.  Detecting bots or spam accounts.
2.  Identifying fraudulent transactions.
3.  Determining if a user is looking for a new job based on website interactions.

*   Ambiguities in these tasks impact prediction accuracy.
*   Consistent and less noisy labels improve learning algorithm performance.

### Data Preparation Considerations

*   Key questions when defining data for learning algorithms:
    1.  What is the input ( x )?
        *   Example: Detecting defects on smartphones.
        *   Considerations: Lighting, camera contrast, camera resolution.
        *   If input quality is poor, improve the sensor or imaging solution.
    2.  What should be the target label ( y )?
        *   Ensuring consistent labeling by labelers is crucial.
        *   Addressing issues like ambiguous labels or insufficiently informative input.

### Improving Data Quality

*   Recognize when sensor or input quality needs improvement.
*   For structured data, defining features to include is crucial.
    *   Example: User location (with permission) can be useful for user ID merge.
*   Ensure labeling instructions are clear to achieve consistent and accurate labels.

## Major types of data problems

In this framework, machine learning projects can be categorized along two axes: the type of data (structured vs. unstructured) and the size of the dataset (small vs. large). This categorization helps in understanding the best practices for organizing and managing data, as different types of projects require different approaches. Let's break down the framework:

### Axes of the Framework:

**Type of Data:**

*   **Unstructured Data:** Includes images, audio, and text. Humans are good at processing this type of data, but it requires more sophisticated techniques to handle in machine learning.
*   **Structured Data:** Includes database records and other well-organized data. This type of data is easier for machines to process directly but might be less intuitive for humans to label or interpret.

**Size of Dataset:**

*   **Small Dataset:** Typically fewer than 10,000 examples. In small datasets, it's feasible to manually inspect and clean the data.
*   **Large Dataset:** Typically more than 10,000 examples. Large datasets require automated processes for labeling and cleaning due to the impracticality of manual inspection.

### Examples:

**Unstructured Data, Small Dataset:**

*   **Example:** Manufacturing visual inspection with 100 images.
*   **Best Practices:** Data augmentation (e.g., synthesizing new images) can be helpful. Manually ensure labels are clean and consistent.

**Structured Data, Small Dataset:**

*   **Example:** Predicting housing prices from 52 examples.
*   **Best Practices:** Manual inspection of data to ensure labels are clean and consistent. Data augmentation is more challenging.

**Unstructured Data, Large Dataset:**

*   **Example:** Speech recognition with 50 million examples.
*   **Best Practices:** Automated processes for data collection and labeling. Data augmentation can be useful (e.g., synthesizing audio with different background noises).

**Structured Data, Large Dataset:**

*   **Example:** Product recommendations for a million users.
*   **Best Practices:** Focus on data processes and labeling instructions for a large team of labelers. Clean labels are still important but harder to manage manually.

### Best Practices Based on Dataset Size:

**Small Datasets:**

*   Clean labels are critical.
*   Manual inspection is feasible.
*   Labeling team is usually small, allowing for easy communication and consistent labeling conventions.

**Large Datasets:**

*   Emphasis on data processes and consistent labeling instructions.
*   Manual inspection is impractical.
*   Labeling team is large, requiring standardized processes and definitions.

### Insights:

*   Unstructured data projects can often benefit from data augmentation techniques, while structured data projects may struggle with generating new data points.
*   Clean labels are essential for both small and large datasets, but the approach to achieving them differs.
*   Advice from individuals who have worked on problems in the same quadrant is often more applicable and useful.

## Small data and label consistency

In problems with a small dataset, having clean and consistent labels is especially important. Let's start with an example: using machine learning to fly helicopters. Suppose you want to take as input the voltage applied to the motor or helicopter rotor and predict the speed of the rotor. This type of problem is not unique to helicopters; it applies to other control problems where you control the speed of a motor. Let's say you have a dataset with just five examples, which is quite small. Because the dataset's output, ( y ), is noisy, it's difficult to determine the function to map voltage to rotor speed in RPM.

### Small Dataset Example

When you have a small dataset with noisy labels, fitting a function confidently becomes challenging. Here are possible functions:

*   A straight line
*   An upward slope that flattens
*   A curve

Each function represents a different hypothesis about the underlying relationship between voltage and rotor speed, but with only five examples, it's hard to choose the correct one.

### Large Dataset Example

If you have a larger dataset, even if it's equally noisy, the learning algorithm can average over the noise and fit a function more confidently. For instance, with many examples, the function might clearly appear as a curve, indicating the relationship between voltage and rotor speed.

### Importance of Clean and Consistent Labels

When dealing with a small dataset, clean and consistent labels are crucial. Consider the same problem with five examples, but now the labels are clean and consistent. In this case, you can fit a function through the data confidently, even with only five examples. This approach has proven effective in various applications, including computer vision systems with just 30 images.

### Example of Phone Defect Inspection

In phone defect inspection, the task is to decide if there is a defect on a phone from input pictures. If the labeling instructions are unclear, different labelers might label images inconsistently, especially in ambiguous regions (e.g., scratches of varying lengths).

#### Approach to Improve Consistency

*   **Gather More Data**: Collect more images of phones with scratches and train a neural network to determine defects. However, this is resource-intensive.
*   **Consensus Among Labelers**: A more efficient approach is to have labelers agree on a standard for labeling defects. For example, they might agree that any scratch over 0.3 millimeters is a defect. This standardization ensures that images are labeled consistently, allowing the learning algorithm to perform better.

### Addressing Long Tail Challenges in Big Data

Even in big data problems, small data challenges exist due to the long tail of rare events. Examples include:

*   **Web Search Engines**: Rare search queries with limited clickstream data.
*   **Self-Driving Cars**: Rare but critical events (e.g., a child running across the highway) with few examples.
*   **Product Recommender Systems**: Items with low sales and limited user interaction data.

### Ensuring Label Consistency

Ensuring label consistency is essential for both small and large datasets. For large datasets, it's often harder to achieve due to the scale, but it remains critical for handling rare events and items in the long tail.

## Improving label consistency

**Assess Label Consistency**

*   Have multiple labelers label the same example.
*   Have the same labeler re-label an example after a break.

**Resolve Disagreements**

*   Convene labelers (e.g., machine label engineers, subject matter experts, dedicated labelers) to discuss and reach agreement on labeling definitions.
*   Document and update labeling instructions.

**Iterative Process**

*   Improve the input ( x ) if necessary (e.g., increase illumination for images).
*   Re-label new or old data using updated instructions.
*   Repeat the process if disagreements persist.

**Examples**

*   **Standardize Labels**: Agree on a consistent labeling convention (e.g., for audio clips).
*   **Merge Classes**: Combine similar classes if distinctions are unclear (e.g., deep vs. shallow scratches).
*   **Create New Classes**: Introduce a borderline class for ambiguous examples (e.g., defects based on scratch length).

**Handling Ambiguity**

*   For unclear audio, introduce an "unintelligible" label rather than forcing inconsistent transcriptions.

**Small vs. Large Datasets**

*   **Small Datasets**: Involve a small number of labelers to discuss specific examples and reach agreement.
*   **Large Datasets**: Establish consistent definitions with a small group, then apply instructions to a larger group.

**Voting Mechanism**

*   Use voting (consensus labeling) to increase accuracy, but prioritize reducing labeler noise through clear definitions.

**Tool Development**

*   Develop tools to detect label inconsistencies and facilitate the process of improving data quality.
*   Aim for tools beyond Jupyter Notebooks to assist in systematic and repeated labeling improvement.

**Human-Level Performance**

*   Important but sometimes misused concept.
*   Will be discussed further in the next video.

## Human level performance (HLP)

**Purpose of HLP:**

*   Establish a baseline of performance for reference.
*   Estimate Bayes error or irreducible error.
*   Useful for analysis and prioritization in unstructured data tasks.

**Evaluating HLP:**

*   Compare machine learning system accuracy to human inspector accuracy.
*   Example: Human inspector agrees with ground truth 66.7% of the time, sets a realistic target for ML systems.

**Challenges with Ground Truth Labels:**

*   Ground truth labels are often determined by humans.
*   Evaluating ML performance may just measure inter-human agreement rather than true potential.

**Applications in Academia:**

*   HLP as a benchmark for publishing.
*   Demonstrating ML systems outperforming HLP can help in academic recognition.

**Business Applications:**

*   HLP can establish realistic performance targets when high accuracy demands (e.g., 99%) are unrealistic.

**Issues with Beating HLP:**

*   Misleading to use HLP to prove ML superiority.
*   Practical business needs often extend beyond high average test set accuracy.
*   Inconsistent labeling instructions can give ML systems an unfair advantage.

**Example of Labeling Inconsistency:**

*   Different labelers may use different conventions (e.g., "nearest gas station" vs. "nearest grocery").
*   ML systems might gain an artificial performance boost by consistently picking the more common convention.

**Implications of Labeling Inconsistencies:**

*   ML systems can appear to outperform HLP but may produce worse results on critical tasks.
*   Performance metrics can be skewed, hiding true deficiencies.

**Recommendations:**

*   Use HLP to set baselines and guide error analysis.
*   Avoid using HLP solely as a benchmark for superiority.
*   Improve label consistency to genuinely raise HLP, resulting in better ML system performance.

**Conclusion:**

*   Measuring HLP is valuable for setting realistic expectations and guiding improvement.
*   Focus on enhancing human labeling consistency to improve overall ML outcomes.

# Label and Organize Data

## Obtaining data

### Best Practices for Obtaining Data

Obtaining data is a critical step in the machine learning process, and it's essential to approach it strategically to ensure efficient and effective model training. Here are some key points to consider:

#### 1. **Start with a Small Initial Dataset**

- **Iterative Process**: Machine learning involves iterative processes—model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and error analysis. You need to loop through these processes multiple times to refine your model.
- **Initial Training**: Begin with a small dataset to quickly get into the iteration loop. Avoid spending excessive time on initial data collection to prevent delays in starting your model training.
- **Error Analysis**: After training your initial model and conducting error analysis, you'll have the opportunity to gather more data if needed.

#### 2. **Quick Data Collection**

- **Time Management**: Instead of spending an extended period (e.g., 30 days) collecting data, aim to collect data quickly, possibly within a few days.
- **Creative Solutions**: Consider creative, scrappy methods to gather data quickly while respecting user privacy and regulatory requirements.
- **Iterative Collection**: Use error analysis from your initial model to guide further data collection, allowing for targeted and efficient gathering of additional data.

#### 3. **Inventory of Data Sources**

- **Brainstorming**: List all possible data sources, considering their costs and time requirements.
- **Example**: For speech recognition, data sources might include owned transcribed speech data, crowdsourced reading data, unlabeled audio data to be transcribed, and commercial data purchases.
- **Cost Analysis**: Evaluate financial costs, time costs, and data quality. Include privacy and regulatory considerations in your analysis.

#### 4. **Labeling Data**

- **Labeling Options**: Common methods include in-house labeling, outsourcing, and crowdsourcing. Choose based on your specific needs and resources.
- **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**: For specialized tasks like medical image diagnosis or factory inspection, use SMEs to ensure accurate labeling.
- **Building Intuition**: Machine learning engineers labeling data can help build project intuition but should not be the primary method for large-scale labeling.

#### 5. **Scaling Up Your Dataset**

- **Incremental Increase**: Avoid increasing your dataset size by more than 10x at a time. Gradual increases (e.g., 2x, 3x, or 10x) allow for manageable changes and continuous evaluation.
- **Error Analysis**: After each dataset size increase, retrain your model and perform error analysis to decide if further data collection is necessary.

#### 6. **Building Data Pipelines**

- **Continuous Process**: Data pipelines are essential when data is collected or processed in stages. Best practices for building and managing these pipelines will ensure data flows smoothly from collection to analysis.

By following these best practices, you can efficiently gather and process data, ultimately improving your machine learning models and achieving better performance in your applications.

## Data pipelines

### Best Practices for Managing Data Pipelines

Data pipelines involve multiple steps of processing that transform raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models. Effective management of data pipelines is crucial for ensuring consistent and replicable results. Here’s a breakdown of best practices:

#### 1. **Initial Data Processing and Cleaning**

- **Preprocessing**: Raw data often needs preprocessing tasks like spam cleanup and user ID merging. Initially, these tasks might be done manually or with scripts.
- **Example**: For predicting if a user is looking for a job, preprocessing may involve cleaning up spam accounts and merging duplicate user IDs.

#### 2. **Replicability of Preprocessing**

- **Development Phase**: During the proof of concept (POC) phase, the focus is on getting a working prototype. It’s acceptable if some preprocessing is manual and scripts are scattered. Document these processes thoroughly.
- **Production Phase**: Once the project is deemed viable, replicability becomes crucial. Ensure that preprocessing scripts are well-documented and standardized to maintain consistency between development and production environments.

#### 3. **Tools for Replicable Data Pipelines**

- **Sophisticated Tools**: In the production phase, use advanced tools to ensure replicability:
  - **TensorFlow Transform**: Useful for preprocessing data in a way that can be integrated into TensorFlow workflows.
  - **Apache Beam**: Provides a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing.
  - **Apache Airflow**: Helps manage and orchestrate complex data workflows.

#### 4. **Documenting and Managing Pipelines**

- **Documentation**: Keep extensive notes and comments on preprocessing steps to facilitate future replication. This is particularly important during the POC phase.
- **Metadata**: Track metadata associated with your data processing steps, including details about the transformations applied.
- **Data Provenance and Lineage**: Maintain records of where data originated, how it was transformed, and how it flows through the pipeline. This helps in debugging and understanding data changes over time.

#### 5. **Handling Complex Pipelines**

- **Complexity Management**: For more complex data pipelines, consider:
  - **Metadata Management**: Ensure that all steps and transformations are well-documented.
  - **Data Lineage**: Track the path of data through various stages of processing to ensure transparency and ease of troubleshooting.

### Summary

- **Initial Phase**: Focus on getting a working prototype, with less emphasis on replicability.
- **Production Phase**: Invest in sophisticated tools and thorough documentation to ensure data processing is replicable and reliable.
- **Complex Pipelines**: Use metadata management and data lineage tracking to handle complexity effectively.

These practices will help ensure that your data pipeline is robust, maintainable, and scalable, leading to more reliable and consistent machine learning models.

## Meta-data, data provencance and lineage

### Key Concepts: Metadata, Data Provenance, and Data Lineage

Understanding and tracking metadata, data provenance, and data lineage is crucial for managing complex data pipelines and ensuring the robustness of machine learning systems. Here’s a detailed explanation:

#### 1. **Data Provenance**
- **Definition**: Data provenance refers to the origin of the data. It involves tracking where the data came from, how it was collected, and who or what generated it.
- **Example**: If you have a spam dataset, data provenance would include information about where the list of blacklisted IP addresses originated and who provided it.

#### 2. **Data Lineage**
- **Definition**: Data lineage describes the sequence of processes and transformations that data undergoes from its origin to its final state.
- **Example**: In your pipeline, data lineage would track the flow of data through various stages:
  - **Raw Data** → **Spam Filtering** → **User ID Merge** → **Final Prediction Model**.
  This helps in understanding the sequence of transformations and their impact on the final output.

#### 3. **Metadata**
- **Definition**: Metadata is "data about data." It provides additional context and information about the data, such as its source, the conditions under which it was collected, and its characteristics.
- **Example**: For image data in manufacturing visual inspections, metadata might include:
  - **Timestamp**: When the image was taken.
  - **Factory Information**: Which factory produced the image.
  - **Camera Settings**: Exposure time, aperture, etc.
  - **Inspector ID**: Who labeled the image.

### Practical Applications and Tips

#### **Managing Complex Data Pipelines**

1. **Tracking and Updating**
   - **Example**: If an IP blacklist needs updating due to mistakes, data lineage helps you understand how changes in the blacklist affect the entire pipeline. Updating the spam dataset will influence the spam model and subsequently affect downstream components like the user ID merge and job prediction models.
   - **Challenge**: Keeping track of updates and their impacts can be challenging if the system is spread across multiple teams and tools.

2. **Documentation**
   - **Importance**: Thorough documentation of data provenance and lineage is essential for maintaining and troubleshooting complex systems. It helps you reconstruct the data pipeline and understand the impact of changes.

3. **Metadata Usage**
   - **Error Analysis**: Metadata can provide insights into anomalies and help identify issues. For instance, if certain data batches show more errors, metadata can help pinpoint the cause (e.g., specific factory lines or camera settings).
   - **Future Utility**: Storing metadata allows you to analyze performance and make improvements based on detailed contextual information.

4. **Tools and Frameworks**
   - **Examples**: Tools like TensorFlow Transform, Apache Beam, and Apache Airflow help manage and track data pipelines. Although tools for data provenance and lineage are still evolving, they can significantly aid in system maintenance and debugging.

5. **Best Practices**
   - **Timely Metadata Storage**: Just as commenting code is important, storing relevant metadata at the right time is crucial for future analysis and maintenance.
   - **Balanced Data Splits**: For reliable model evaluation, ensure balanced splits of training, development, and testing datasets. This prevents biases and ensures robust model performance.

### Summary

- **Data Provenance**: Understand where your data originates from.
- **Data Lineage**: Track the sequence of data transformations and their effects.
- **Metadata**: Capture additional information about your data to aid in error analysis and system maintenance.

Maintaining these aspects ensures that complex data pipelines are manageable, changes are traceable, and performance issues can be effectively addressed.

## Balanced train/dev/test splits

### Importance of Balanced Train, Dev, and Test Splits

When working with small datasets, ensuring a balanced split for training, development (dev), and test sets is crucial for reliable machine learning performance evaluation. Here’s why:

#### **Balanced Split Explanation**
- **Balanced Split**: A balanced split means that each subset of your data (train, dev, test) maintains the same proportion of positive and negative examples as the entire dataset. For instance, if your dataset has 30% positive examples, each split should ideally have around 30% positive examples.

#### **Example Scenario**
- **Dataset**: 100 images with 30 positive (defective) and 70 negative (non-defective).
- **Random Split Issue**: If you randomly split the data, you might end up with uneven distributions in your subsets:
  - **Training Set**: 60 images, potentially 21 positive examples (35%).
  - **Dev Set**: 20 images, potentially 2 positive examples (10%).
  - **Test Set**: 20 images, potentially 7 positive examples (35%).

  This uneven distribution can make the dev and test sets non-representative of the overall dataset, leading to unreliable performance evaluation.

#### **Why Balanced Splits Matter**
- **Small Datasets**: With small datasets, random splits are more likely to result in imbalanced subsets. For instance, with only 20 dev and test examples each, a random split might produce sets that do not accurately reflect the overall distribution of positives and negatives.
- **Large Datasets**: For large datasets, random splits tend to be representative because the large number of samples means that each subset will likely approximate the overall distribution.

#### **Benefits of Balanced Splits**
- **Improved Representativeness**: Ensures that each subset accurately represents the true distribution of classes in the data.
- **Reliable Performance Evaluation**: Makes the dev and test sets more reliable for evaluating your model’s performance.

#### **How to Achieve Balanced Splits**
- **Manual Stratified Sampling**: Ensure each subset has the same proportion of positive and negative examples as the whole dataset.
- **Automated Tools**: Use libraries and tools that support stratified sampling to maintain balance in each subset.

### Summary

For small datasets, using a balanced train, dev, and test split helps ensure that each subset of your data is representative of the overall dataset distribution. This leads to more reliable performance evaluation and better model development. For larger datasets, while random splits are generally sufficient, keeping these principles in mind can still be beneficial.

# Scoping

## What is scoping?

### Scoping and Selecting AI Projects

Choosing the right project is crucial for maximizing the impact and effectiveness of your work in AI. Here’s a structured approach to scoping and selecting the most promising AI projects:

#### **1. Identifying Potential Projects**

**Brainstorming**: Start by brainstorming a range of potential projects based on the needs and goals of your organization or the problem you want to address. For example, an e-commerce retailer might consider:
- **Product Recommendation System**: Enhance the recommendation engine to increase sales.
- **Improved Search Functionality**: Improve search algorithms to help customers find products more easily.
- **Catalog Data Quality**: Address missing or incomplete data in product catalogs.
- **Inventory Management**: Optimize inventory decisions, such as quantity to order, pricing strategies, and shipment logistics.

#### **2. Evaluating Project Value**

- **Sales Increase**: Measure how much additional revenue or sales the project generates.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Assess improvements in user experience or customer satisfaction scores.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Evaluate cost savings or efficiency improvements in operations.

**Impact Assessment**: Estimate the potential impact of each project. Some projects might provide significantly higher value compared to others. For example, improving the recommendation system might directly increase sales by a larger margin than fixing catalog data quality issues.

#### **3. Assessing Resources**

**Data Requirements**: Determine the data needed for each project and evaluate whether you have access to the required data. This might include customer data, product information, or historical sales data.

**Time and Effort**: Estimate the time and effort required to complete the project. Consider factors like the complexity of the problem, the expertise required, and the project's scope.

**Team and Skills**: Identify the team members required and their expertise. Ensure you have the right mix of skills and resources, including data scientists, engineers, and domain experts.

#### **4. Making the Decision**

**Prioritization**: Based on the value, resource requirements, and feasibility, prioritize the projects. Projects with the highest potential impact and manageable resource requirements should be prioritized.

**Feasibility Analysis**: Conduct a feasibility analysis for each project to ensure it’s achievable within the given constraints (data availability, timeline, budget, etc.).

**Iterative Refinement**: Be prepared to refine your project scope as you gather more information. Initial ideas might need adjustments based on further analysis and feedback.

### Summary

1. **Brainstorm Potential Projects**: Generate a list of possible projects based on organizational needs and opportunities.
2. **Evaluate Value**: Assess the potential impact and define success metrics for each project.
3. **Assess Resources**: Determine the data, time, and team required for each project.
4. **Prioritize and Decide**: Choose projects that offer the highest value with manageable resources and feasibility.

By carefully scoping and selecting projects, you can ensure that your AI efforts are focused on initiatives that provide the most significant impact and align with your strategic goals.

## Scoping process

### Scoping Projects: Best Practices for Identifying and Selecting AI Solutions

**1. Identify Business Problems**

**Engage with Stakeholders**: Begin by collaborating with business or product owners to understand their key challenges and goals. Focus on identifying the core business problems rather than jumping straight into AI solutions.

**Example Questions**:
- For an e-commerce retailer, ask: What are the top three things you wish were working better? This might include increasing conversions, reducing inventory, or increasing profit margins.

**2. Separate Problem Identification from Solution Identification**

**Problem First**: Clearly articulate the business problem without considering solutions. This helps in understanding the true nature of the problem and prevents bias towards any particular solution.

**Solution Brainstorming**: Once the problem is well-defined, brainstorm potential AI solutions. Not all business problems can be solved with AI, but this step helps in exploring viable options.

**3. Evaluate Solutions**

**Feasibility Assessment**: Evaluate the technical feasibility of each potential AI solution. This includes assessing data availability, computational requirements, and technical complexity.

**Value and ROI**: Determine the potential impact and return on investment (ROI) of each solution. Consider how much value the solution will bring to the business and whether it's worth pursuing.

**4. Conduct Due Diligence**

**Double-Check Feasibility**: Ensure that the solution is technically achievable and aligns with the business needs. This involves validating assumptions and ensuring that the proposed solution can deliver the expected results.

**ROI Evaluation**: Verify the anticipated ROI by comparing the projected benefits with the costs and resources required.

**5. Plan and Budget**

**Define Milestones**: Set clear milestones for the project to track progress and ensure timely delivery. Milestones should include key deliverables and timelines.

**Resource Budgeting**: Estimate the resources needed, including data, time, and team members. Allocate budget and resources based on the project's requirements and priorities.

**6. Divergent and Convergent Thinking**

**Divergent Thinking**: Start with a broad brainstorming session to generate a wide range of ideas and solutions. This encourages creativity and explores various possibilities.

**Convergent Thinking**: Narrow down the options to the most promising projects based on feasibility and value. Focus on a few high-impact solutions rather than spreading efforts too thin.

**7. Avoid Premature Commitment**

**Evaluate Alternatives**: Before committing to a project, consider whether there are alternative projects that could offer significantly greater value with similar or less effort.

**Example Application**:
- **Increase Conversion**: Potential solutions might include improving search functionality, enhancing product recommendations, redesigning product pages, or optimizing product reviews.

## Diligence on feasbility and value

This detailed approach to assessing technical feasibility is insightful and practical. Here’s a summary of the key points for evaluating a project’s feasibility and how you can apply them:

### Assessing Technical Feasibility

1. **External Benchmarking:**
   - **Use Research Literature:** Check if similar projects have been done before. If others have successfully built similar systems, it can be a good indicator of feasibility.
   - **Look at Competitors:** Assess if competitors or other companies have implemented similar solutions successfully.

2. **Two-by-Two Matrix for Feasibility:**
   - **Unstructured Data (e.g., images, speech):**
     - **New Projects:** Use Human Level Performance (HLP) to gauge feasibility. If humans can perform the task given the same data, it’s likely feasible for a learning algorithm.
     - **Existing Projects:** Compare the performance of existing systems with human performance benchmarks. If human performance is achievable, improvements are possible.
   - **Structured Data (e.g., transaction records):**
     - **New Projects:** Check if predictive features are available. Determine if existing features are strongly predictive of the target output.
     - **Existing Projects:** Look for new predictive features that can enhance the current system. Assess the history of the project's progress to estimate future improvements.

3. **Key Concepts for Feasibility:**
   - **Human Level Performance (HLP):** Benchmark if humans can perform the task with the given data. This is especially useful for unstructured data tasks.
   - **Predictive Features:** Evaluate if you have features that are predictive of the target outcome. For structured data problems, ensure that your input features are relevant and predictive.
   - **History of the Project:** Analyze past progress to estimate future improvements. Use historical data to predict future performance and set realistic expectations.

### Applying These Concepts:

- **Unstructured Data Example:** For tasks like image classification (e.g., detecting traffic light colors), if humans can reliably perform the task with the images provided, then it’s likely feasible for a learning algorithm as well. If a human cannot reliably perform the task with the given data, the project may be infeasible with the current setup.

- **Structured Data Example:** For predicting future purchases based on past purchase data, if past purchases are predictive of future behavior, the project has a good chance of success. However, predicting future stock prices based only on historical prices is often challenging and may be technically infeasible without additional features.

- **History of Progress:** If a project has shown steady improvement in error reduction, it’s reasonable to project continued progress. For example, if a speech recognition system’s error rate has consistently decreased, you can use this trend to estimate future performance improvements.

This structured approach helps ensure that you focus on projects that are both technically feasible and valuable. By carefully evaluating feasibility through these lenses, you can avoid investing time and resources into projects that are unlikely to succeed.

## Diligence on value

Estimating the value of a machine learning project involves understanding both technical and business metrics, as well as considering ethical implications. Here’s a structured approach to evaluate the value of a project:

### Estimating the Value of a Machine Learning Project

1. **Aligning Technical and Business Metrics:**
   - **Technical Metrics:** These might include specific performance measures like word-level accuracy for a speech recognition system.
   - **Business Metrics:** These include metrics that affect the business outcomes, such as query-level accuracy, user engagement, or revenue.

   **Example:**
   - **Speech Recognition System:** The machine learning team might focus on improving word-level accuracy, while the business team might prioritize query-level accuracy and overall search result quality. Bridging this gap involves finding metrics that align with both teams' goals.

2. **Compromising on Metrics:**
   - **Find Common Ground:** Both technical and business teams should agree on a set of metrics that balance technical feasibility with business impact.
   - **Stretch Goals:** The technical team might stretch to meet business metrics, while the business team might adjust expectations based on technical constraints.

3. **Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations:**
   - **Estimate Impact:** Use rough calculations to relate improvements in technical metrics to business outcomes.
   - **Fermi Estimates:** Even crude estimates can provide insight into how changes in one area (e.g., word-level accuracy) might affect others (e.g., search result quality or revenue).

   **Example:**
   - **Improving Word-Level Accuracy:** If word-level accuracy improves by 1%, estimate how this might improve query-level accuracy, which in turn could affect user engagement and revenue.

4. **Ethical Considerations:**
   - **Net Positive Societal Value:** Assess whether the project contributes positively to society and whether it avoids harmful biases.
   - **Fairness and Transparency:** Ensure the project is fair, free from biases, and that any ethical concerns are openly discussed within the team.
   - **Ethical Frameworks:** Refer to industry-specific ethical frameworks to guide decision-making.

   **Example:**
   - **Healthcare Applications:** Consider the potential for bias in predicting patient outcomes or treatment recommendations and ensure the project adheres to ethical standards.

5. **Team Discussions:**
   - **Open Debate:** Engage the team in discussions about the project’s societal impact and ethical implications.
   - **Reevaluation:** If a project does not seem to provide a net positive impact, be prepared to pivot to other projects that are more meaningful and beneficial.

   **Example:**
   - **Project Evaluation:** A project with strong economic value but questionable societal impact may be reconsidered or discontinued in favor of projects that have a clearer positive impact on humanity.

### Summary

Estimating the value of a machine learning project involves balancing technical improvements with business outcomes and ethical considerations. By aligning metrics, performing impact estimates, and engaging in ethical discussions, you can better assess whether a project is worth pursuing and how it will benefit both the business and society.

## Milestones and resourcing

Here’s a structured approach for determining milestones and resourcing for a machine learning project:

### Scoping Process: Milestones and Resourcing

1. **Define Key Specifications:**
   - **Machine Learning Metrics:**
     - **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the model’s predictions.
     - **Precision-Recall:** For classification tasks, particularly with imbalanced datasets.
     - **Fairness Metrics:** Assess any biases in the model’s predictions.
   - **Software Metrics:**
     - **Latency:** Time taken to make predictions or responses.
     - **Throughput:** Number of queries processed per second.
     - **System Resource Utilization:** CPU, GPU, memory usage, etc.

   **Example:**
   - For a real-time recommendation system, you might set a target latency of <200ms and aim for 500 queries per second.

2. **Estimate Business Metrics:**
   - **Incremental Revenue:** Estimate how the improvements will impact revenue.
   - **User Engagement:** Predict changes in user engagement and retention.
   - **Cost Savings:** Determine potential savings in operational costs.

   **Example:**
   - If the project aims to enhance user experience, you might estimate that a 5% increase in user engagement could lead to a 2% increase in revenue.

3. **Determine Resources Needed:**
   - **Data:**
     - **Quantity:** How much data is required?
     - **Sources:** Where will the data come from?
   - **Personnel:**

     - **Support:** Data handling support, cloud services, etc.

   **Example:**
   - You might need 500GB of labeled data, a data engineering team to handle data preprocessing, and integration support from the IT team.

4. **Establish a Timeline:**
   - **Milestones:**
     - **Initial Research:** Understanding the problem and potential solutions.
     - **Proof of Concept (POC):** Building and evaluating a prototype.
     - **Development:** Full-scale implementation and optimization.
     - **Testing:** Validation and quality assurance.
     - **Deployment:** Rollout and monitoring.
   - **Deliverables:**
     - Define what needs to be delivered at each milestone and the deadlines for each.

   **Example:**
   - **POC Completion:** 2 months
   - **Development Phase:** 4 months
   - **Testing and Deployment:** 2 months

5. **Benchmarking and Proof of Concept:**
   - **Benchmarking:** Compare with similar projects to set realistic goals.
   - **POC:** Build a prototype to validate feasibility and refine specifications before full-scale development.

   **Example:**
   - If developing a new NLP model, compare against existing models and create a prototype to test feasibility before committing to a full-scale model development.

### Summary

When scoping a machine learning project, clearly define key metrics, estimate the business impact, determine the required resources, and establish a timeline with milestones. If necessary, use benchmarking or a proof of concept to refine these specifications. This thorough approach ensures that the project is well-planned and has a higher likelihood of success.
